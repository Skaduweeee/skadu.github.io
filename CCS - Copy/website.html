    <a href="https://www.vainglorygame.com/" target="_blank"><b>Vainglory</b> </a> 
    is a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) developed and published by 
    <a href="https://superevilmegacorp.com/" target="_blank">
         Super Evil Megacorp</a> on <b>November 16, 2014</b> in iOS and <b>July 2, 2015</b> in Android. The game was awarded Editor's Choice in App store which is tagged as one of the best application/game for that year. Each Editor's choice is curated by the editorial team of App Store, and being awarded of it is no easy feat. The first release of the game was a 3v3 version where teams destroy the enemy by controlling the path between the bases, lined by turrets and guarded by AI-controlled enemy creatures called minions. Vainglory received favorable reviews from the community and even highly-acknowledged game critics. The game's level design, characters, and graphics were acclaimed by critics, although some faulted it for lacking team communication features. Its mixed reception was partly due to divergent opinions from reviewers over how beginner-friendly the game was.

        The game is basically just another MOBA. It showcases a variety of heroes,  unique skills, personalized talents, hybrid item builds, and even extravagant skins. But unlike other games, Vainglory has a unique mode of gaming. It was tagged as a game perfected for touch. Instead of the classic joysticks used for mobile MOBA, Vainglory's default mode of movement is by touch, in touching ground, you're commanding the hero to move to that touched area. It is also unlike any  game where you need to purchase skins for real cash, Vainglory has a crafting system where you need to obtain cards ranging from common, rare, and legendary for skin crafting. These cards are dropped after a game based on chance. Its ranking system is one of the hardest to climb, ranging from Tier 1 (Just Beginning) to Tier 10 (Vainglorious) and this system is so balanced that you are always queued with people on your same skill level with your rank bracket.

        Vainglory was basically the game that I was addicted the most. The graphics, gameplay, matchmaking system, ranking system, laning, and even the skins are all topnotch. I still remember when I was Grade 7 and games were not allowed in our iPad as it is used solely for studying, Foundation Preparatory Academy basically has a paperless education system. In line with the academy's pursuit of learning, they always conduct a routine check of iPads to see if we have games downloaded and have it uninstalled or seize if there are a lot of games. I can still remember to this day a memorable moment where I was playing Vainglory in our classroom which was basically a laboratory, it has hexagon-like tables and compartments underneath where we can put our bags in. A routine check was conducted at 5 in the afternoon by one and only Sir Joel(the iPad overseer). I was in-game and I always put the game in high regard as leaving a match will result to bad karma, the same concept with low priority in Dota 2 but much worse. So as he was climbing up the stairs of the building, my classmates shouted <b><i>idelete na inyohang dula bai, naa nas Sir Joel</i></b>, I was shocked to death and adrenaline came rushing through, in a split second, I decided to hide inside the table compartment to evade his evil attack in our pursuit to Vainglorious.

        Dismissal was at 5 in the afternoon and I'll always spend the next two hours of it playing Vainglory in the butterfly area even though it's dark. It was like that for two whole years and the highest rank I attained was Tier 8 (Simply Amazing). My main hero is ringo and after 2 years, I crafted the legendary skin which I will show below. All Tier 3 skins or legendary skins do have special effects which is more aesthetic compared to Mobile Legends in my opinion. When I was in 9th grade, there was a Vainglory tournament facilitated by the College of Computer Studies of Foundation University which we joined. Sadly, we were ranked 4th due to a miscalcuation in the final clash. Overall, Vainglory is the greatest game I ever played. I am hoping that it will recover and revived by the developers as it is now in community edition.

    <p style="margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 80px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 80px; color:black; font-family:Arial Narrow Bold; font-size: 130%; border-bottom: 2px solid;border-color: black;">
         Vainglory is a topnotch game. It requires a decent device as it is quite heavy and it takes a ton of practice to be good at the game, which is the very reason of its decline after the release of Mobile Legends in 2016. There was a lack of communication feature in-game for better teamfights but its development was too late. The developer are also not inclined to marketing as they took pride with their work with a motto of <i>"A game speaks for itself" </i> There were still a lot of players for sure but  because of its crafting system, players were not really into purchasing as crafting skins became something to brag about. The game was not pulling in enough money to keep the developer's support of the game which led to them selling the game to another developer in 2019 to keep it alive. They introduced the 5v5 feature to keep up with Mobile Legends but its release was not sufficient to keep the game alive. 3 years passed already since support was withheld. Now, it's still in community edition and accounts are inexistent. Matchmaking takes a lot of time but there are still die-hard supporters playing the game which is evident by the discord servers created just for the sake of playing the game every night.
